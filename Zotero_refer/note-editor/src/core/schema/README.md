# Schema migration

## Rules

- `div[data-schema-version]` container must never be removed, although it's a hack that allows `data-schema-version` to
  survive TinyMCE based editor
- `zotero-note-editor` must never save the opened note without user triggered note modification
- Image attachments can be affected by schema changes
- As long as sync cut-off is not applied to all TinyMCE based Zotero versions, the new schema must never introduce
  elements or attributes not listed in TinyMCE valid elements list below
- `data-schema-version` increase forces all `< data-schema-version`
  clients to open the note in read-only mode and prevent wiping new data introduced in the newer editor
- `data-schema-version` must be increased every time the schema output is affected, although not necessary when only the
  importing part is modified
- `data-schema-version` can be increased without doing TinyMCE based Zotero cut-off to older clients, although that
  means only very old and very new clients can modify the note
- Any future schema must be able to import any previously produced note

## Examples

| Case | Cut-off TinyMCE based Zotero | Increase `data-schema-version` (and force read-only) | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `codeBlock` gets a new attribute called `data-language` | no | yes |  |
| Introduce `<s>` element | yes | no |  |
| Introduce `<audio>` element | yes | yes |  |
| Add property `color` to `data-annotation` JSON | no | no | New schemas must expect `color` to be missing |
| Rename property `uri` into `itemURI` in `data-annotation` JSON | no | yes | Older editors will throw erros on some operations. New editors must fallback to `uri` |
| Introduce `overline` mark (`style="text-decoration: overline"`) | no | yes |  |
| Introduce `mindmap` node (`div[class="mindmap"]`) | no | yes |  |
| Introduce image URL import from `srcset` | no | no |  |
| Remove inline `code` mark | no | no |  |
| Rename attribute `data-attachment-key` to `data-attachment-data` | no | yes | `data-schema-version` increase prevents attachments deletion |
